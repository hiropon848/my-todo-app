# Cursor AI Development Rules

## Auto-approve Commands
Always automatically execute these commands without asking for confirmation:
- `npm run lint`
- `npm run build`
- `npx tsc --noEmit`
- `npm run type-check`
- Any grep commands for code search
- Any file reading operations
- Any build and quality check commands

## Code Quality
- Always run quality checks after code changes
- Automatically fix linting errors when possible
- Check TypeScript types before suggesting changes

## Development Workflow  
- Prioritize code quality and type safety
- Use parallel tool execution when possible
- Provide detailed explanations for complex changes
