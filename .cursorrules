# Cursor AI Development Rules

## Auto-approve Commands
Always automatically execute these commands without asking for confirmation:
- `npm run lint`
- `npm run build`
- `npx tsc --noEmit`
- `npm run type-check`
- Any grep commands for code search
- Any file reading operations
- Any build and quality check commands

## Post-Implementation Quality Assurance
After any code implementation or modification, ALWAYS execute the following sequence:
1. `npm run lint` - Check and auto-fix linting issues
2. `npx tsc --noEmit` - Verify TypeScript compilation
3. `npm run build` - Ensure successful build

## Error Handling Workflow
If quality checks fail:
1. Analyze the error output carefully
2. Apply necessary fixes to the code
3. Re-run the failed check
4. Maximum 3 retry attempts per file
5. If still failing after 3 attempts, ask user for guidance

## Mandatory Quality Gates
- Never consider implementation "complete" until all quality checks pass
- Always report quality check results to the user
- Provide clear error explanations and proposed fixes
- Use parallel execution for multiple quality checks when possible
- Prioritize code quality and type safety
- Provide detailed explanations for complex changes
